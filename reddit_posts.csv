I don't like my French class,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ImposterSyndrome/comments/1ndwf0u/i_dont_like_my_french_class/,"In high school, I was one of the best in French. No doubt about it. Over the summer, I didn't speak or read or write in French very frequently, if at all. I placed into higher level French class in my college. I'm the only freshman in there and I feel so fucking stupid. I feel like I'm not as good as I used to be. I'm barely surviving so far. I wanted to major in French, but I don't think I want to anymore. I just don't like my class, it's too small so there's no anonymity. It's impossible to go unnoticed. My professor speaks a mile a minute. I don't know anyone in there and I feel like everyone thinks I'm a fucking idiot. I'm a lot better at writing than speaking but DAMN if I don't feel stupid every time I walk into that room.

Is this just imposter syndrome? Idk.","In high school, I was one of the best in French. No doubt about it. Over the summer, I didn't speak or read or write in French very frequently, if at all.

I lied on my resume and now Corporate wants me,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ImposterSyndrome/comments/1n9qagp/i_lied_on_my_resume_and_now_corporate_wants_me/,"Let this be known right out the gate..the skills and abilities are there. Ive done the work. Ive put in the time (20 years). I know the technical and artisanal aspects and have the skills required to do the job. I HAVE done the jobs, but due to the nature of my industry (male dominated with inflated egos aplenty) I was never given the titles I rightfully deserved. I had either been passed over for another man, kept at a lower paying position because “youre really good in this spot and we need you HERE”, dismissed or outright told “its because we don't see you being here that long.” Ive also been highlighted in digital publications as well as done freelance work for high end companies. I have friends in high places that have called me seeking hiring advice and suggestions with plating and building flavor profiles The work is by no means glamorous but it’s certainly glamorized. Fast forward to where I am and where I will be soon. I currently teach my passion at a 2 year tech college and have been referred by a colleague to a friend of theirs (Corporate Executive Chef of a prominent fine dining restaurant group)for a job opportunity. I emailed the contact, attached my resume and off it went. This guy was, in his words, impressed by my resume and wanted me to sit down with him and his corporate pastry chef. I figured it would be a part time pastry prep position as my availability was limited. Upon meeting these two gentleman, I was pleasantly surprised and shocked to learn they want me to alleviate the corporate pastry chefs duties (hes the only one) and help to create consistency and efficiency within prep and dinner service across NINE FUCKING RESTAURANTS!!! I can do this, I know I can but the imposter syndrome is really setting in hard and I dont know how to work past it. The only thing i lied about on my resume is one title, the skills and work duties are real. This was the job that had me create their first ever dessert menu, had me train everyone for pastry/garde mange, I took the initiative to create their first ever standard recipe book in the whole restaurant, purchasing, procuring, creation, R&D, asked for an additional seasonal menu (we were transitioning from winter to spring) plus a restaurant week menu, I was also the ONLY TOURNANT (“floater” i moved from pastry to hotline for three positions [saute 1 & 2 and fry] and then had the nerve to tell me my name couldn’t be on the menu because “they didnt think I would be there that long”, everything else is true. As Im typing this it feels like a no brainer on my unnecessary thoughts of feeling like a phony but I think its the ultimate level up thats scaring me into thinking I dont deserve this or I didnt earn this. This is an amazing opportunity and needless to say life changing. I just cant help but to feel like Im a fake because of this one lie I put on my resume. My friend was the GM of that place that told me they didnt think I would be there that long and tells me “No girl you were the Pastry Chef and Tournant, youre not lying, you just had to work with stupid ass dudes whos egos couldnt stand the fact that a woman was creating a better environment and was outshining them on all levels.

How do you internalize success - baby elephant sydrome,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ImposterSyndrome/comments/1my2zoc/how_do_you_internalize_success_baby_elephant/,"Hi folks,

I used to be loosy and kind of loser when I was young. Growing up I have very big achievements in my life, in multiple areas, things that I couldnt even imagine when I was young. I have written books, spoken to conferences, being highly respected in one of the biggest companies in my region, where I am employed. People think of me as a role model in various areas of life. So not just a couple of wins, that I have maximized in my mind to ease my insecurities. On the contrary I used to belittle them.

I feel I am having the baby elephant syndrome. Even though my current state has nothing to do with the past, I am struggling to internalize those wins and my new identity in general. Sometimes I even feel like people are doing me a favor for keeping me in their lives.

I have read various articles on how to deal with it, though I would like to hear how do you or a loved one approached it and solved it.

P.S: I am focusing on self development here, please refrain from suggesting me to outsource it to a therapist.","Hi folks,
